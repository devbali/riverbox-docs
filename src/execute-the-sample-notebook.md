- Here, you can click execute on the top bar, and from the drop-down select Run All to execute all cells (boxes) of this Notebook
- To do a Jupyter Notebook style execution, you can also select "Debug Mode"

## Execution Page
- The execution page will show the cells with an execution counter on the top
- On the second navbar, there should be a status indicator on the status of the execution
- The execution should start with maybe a slight delay, and boxes should turn green (successful, complete execution) and yellow (in progress)
- After the execution is completely finished, your screen should look something like this
